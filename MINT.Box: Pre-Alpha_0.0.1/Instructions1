Instructions for this I guess lmao!
Code files are in src. Catalogue stuff is in catalogue.js (lol).
To run it, download Node.js and get npm/npx. Get download React using npm, then just run 'npm start' to run the file.
To terminate the file, just type 'npx kill-port 3000'. If your file is not running in the port 3000, put whatever port instead of 3000.
If stuck, ask me.

Welp, we don't have the files. To run the build, first install serve using 'npm install -g serve'. Then 'serve -s build' will run the
web-app at localhost://5000. This should be copied to your clipboard so just post this into your browser and it should work. Huzzah!
